<h1>Substance look & feel - NetBeans module</h1>
<p>The goal of this subproject is to provide UI delegates for 
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a> custom components.
This project is an extension of <a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">Substance</a>
look-and-feel.</p>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>

<h3>Using this plugin for NetBeans</h3>
<p>As NetBeans is Swing application, it can be run under any look-and-feel. See 
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/50/substance-look-and-feel.html">this excellent article</a>
that describes how to run NetBeans under core <b>Substance</b> look-and-feel.</p>

<p>In addition, NetBeans defines two custom components, <b>tabbed container</b> and
<b>sliding button</b>. You can see them in the above screenshots. This subproject
provides NetBeans module that provides UI delegates for these two custom NetBeans
components. <b>Tim Boudreau</b> of NetBeans team was kind enough to join this project and to provide
support for turning this plugin into a NetBeans module. 
You can download the NetBeans module from <b>Documents &amp; Files</b> section
and register it as any regular module. The next
run of NetBeans will automatically pick up the <b>Substance</b> look-and-feel.</p>
